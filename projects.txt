1. Phishing URL Detection System

Problem Statement:
Phishing attacks often use fake URLs to steal user credentials. Detecting phishing URLs automatically helps prevent cyber threats.

Tech Stack:
Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Flask, HTML/CSS

Key Features:

Extracts features from URLs (length, special characters, domain info)

Trains a Machine Learning model for classification

Real-time URL checking via a simple Flask web app

Accuracy visualization using graphs

Outcome:
Built a system that accurately predicts whether a URL is safe or malicious.

One-line Resume Description:
"Developed a Python-based ML model integrated with Flask to detect phishing URLs with high accuracy."

2. Log File Analyzer for Security Events

Problem Statement:
Server logs often contain huge data. Manually detecting suspicious login attempts or anomalies is inefficient.

Tech Stack:
Python, Regex, Pandas, Matplotlib

Key Features:

Parses system/server log files automatically

Detects failed logins, brute-force attempts, and unusual activity

Generates visual reports for security analysis

Exports summarized reports in CSV format

Outcome:
Created a Python tool to detect security events quickly using log analysis.

One-line Resume Description:
"Built a Python-based log analysis tool to detect security anomalies and generate visualization reports."

3. Password Strength Checker

Problem Statement:
Weak passwords are a common cause of security breaches. A simple tool to check password strength can improve security awareness.

Tech Stack:
Python, Tkinter (GUI), Regex

Key Features:

Evaluates password length, character variety, and entropy

Checks for dictionary words or common passwords

Gives real-time feedback on password strength

Simple user interface for ease of use

Outcome:
Designed a GUI-based Python application to check and improve password strength.

One-line Resume Description:
"Developed a GUI-based Python application to analyze and rate password strength for better security."
